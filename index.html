<h1>Written in H1 tag</h1>
<h5>Written in H5 - there are 6 header tags in HTML5 </h5>
<h6>Written in H6 - Tags are important to identify the piece of element in the web
page, and also header tags play vital role in making the site more accessible as
it helps the screen reader to point out specific information, and tags play 
important role in web crawling by search engines (SEO).</h6>

<div>
	<h4>Tags can also be present inside div tag (division), which is used to design webpage as modules and specify a certain portion while using CSS</h4>
	<input> - Insert tag to get inputs from user and these are self closing tags.
	<button> So far so good!!</button>

	<p>Paragraph tag - used to write long sentences in the webpage</p>
	<p>So far, whatever and however we write, there won't be any formatting done by
		the browser. for ex: If i write this sentence in each seperate lines, browser will 
		show it as a single line
	WHATEVER!! 
		<br>
		To solve this issue we use 'br' tag to break the lines
		<br>and alrady i have used it twice to showcase.!!! 
		<hr>
		Another way to divide content into sections/themes is this 'hr' tag - horizontal rule
		<br> to draw a simple line in the middle of a webpage.
		<hr>

		For people who write poems, who likes formatted content not to be messed up - HTML has a 'pre' tag which looks like this:
		<pre><b>
        Time's glory is to calm contending kings,
	To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
	To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
	To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
	To wrong the wronger till he render right;
	 </b></pre>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  (will be using this stanza in the coming days!!)
